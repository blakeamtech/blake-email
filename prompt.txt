If you don't think about how your model will be productionized from the gecko, your project is doomed to FAIL👇


This happened in a real-life project at Google. The project entailed predicting contractor invoice amounts over 12 months upon the contract creation.


The Finance team needed this to project costs and plan a budget.


A colleague built a regression model using KNN. Surprisingly, this simple algorithm beat superior ones like XGBoost and neural networks. 


The stakeholder was impressed, and the project signed off for production.


But, this is where a major problem emerged. KNN is extremely slow... Unlike other models, training time is the inference time.


As part of the requirement, the client needed a prediction that's real-time. And, KNN is the WORST solution for that.


Our team ended up scrapping the effort, which involved two months of development, and we had to start over.


This issue is not uncommon. More often than not, a DS or ML engineer gets excited about the result they see in the development phase. However, they fail to see how the features and/or models they use are not practical in the real world.


That's why one thing I always emphasize, which is a MUST for ML education, is that students should learn how to deploy a model and the best practices around that.

<<COMMENT>>
Time complexity of KNN is O(n • d), where n is the number of training examples and d is the number of features. Even if d is small, that'll become infeasible for real-time once n is in the thousands. Why anyone would use KNN for that is beyond me.

A portfolio company invited me as a speaker at its own team retreat.


Last year ScaleForge spun out from High Output Ventures as it started to grow rapidly. 


They help fintech companies streamline their data processing pipelines and bring down infrastructure costs dramatically.


I have been coaching the CEO Roger Madjos for nearly 10 years and am immensely proud of what he has built.

There are two types of AI experts thanks to LLMs:


- The Grandmaster: 'Yeah, I used the OpenAI API and Langchain. Now I can call myself an AI expert. Let me teach you how to do it.’


- The Imposter: 'This is so frustrating. Iterating on the prompt doesn't improve it much. Fine-tuning doesn't help either. What's going on with my data? I call myself an AI expert, but what do I really know?'

Microsoft repeatedly makes this strategic error:




Fixating on competitors instead of customers.


I remember the Zune vs iPod battles vividly.


Apple didn't win in the end because of:
↳ Bigger storage
↳ Longer battery life
↳ More features


Apple won because it stayed focused on giving customers what they wanted:
↳ All their music in their pocket
↳ An intuitive user experience
↳ Integration with iTunes and the Apple ecosystem


As someone who has made this mistake many times, it requires a shift in mindset and how we run our businesses.


We have one primary goal:
🌟 Enable our customers to be better off after using our product/service than they were before.


Some key ways to do this:
▸ Deeply understand customer needs and pain points
▸ Prioritize customer impact over competitor metrics
▸ Relentlessly gather customer feedback and iterate
▸ Foster a customer-centric culture


Stop fixating on your competition and start obsessing over your customers. Put them at the center of every decision.


Do any other such prominent examples come to mind?

This week, I challenge you to:
‣ Identify where your effort falls short.
‣ Commit to three actions to bridge the gap.
‣ Share your commitment with a trusted friend.


Greatness is not a destination but a continuous journey of matching your effort to your ambition.

Seeing a lot of LinkedIn influencers playing the sympathy card with jobseekers to gain more traction, subconsciously inflicting a victim mindset:


- "It's not you; it's the economy."
- "Even your batchmates don't have jobs, so it's okay."


While this may sound soothing, it fosters false satisfaction and complacency which is detrimental to the job search process.


Don't have an interview? Introspect, network, and do a root cause analysis.
Couldn't clear an interview? Do the same. Go to any lengths to be an exceptional case who gets a cool job in your herd.


Avoid a victim mentality at all costs.

Ever heard of embracing the suck?


It's about facing challenges head-on when learning something new.


I'm currently working to improve my short form writing. 


Here's how I'm working on getting better:


1 . Consume content from top writers like Shaan Puri, David Perell, Nicolas Cole, and Dickie Bush.


2. I always look for 80/20 when looking at a new skill and work to identify the 20% that drives all the value.


3. Break down the 20%, in the case of writing it includes copywork, storytelling, editing and headlines etc.


4. Posting every day, I get constant feedback on what works and what doesn't. Feedback is critical.


5. Every day, I review my posts, the feedback and aim to make it 1% better and let that compound over time.


I believe this cycle can be applied to learn any new skill:


→ Find experts in the field and follow them.
→ Distill the 80/20 of the skill.
→ Break it down and focus on improving each part.
→ Get daily feedback on your output.
→ Ensure you're getting 1% better consistently.


Every skill you have today, you once sucked at.


Be clear about what you want, embrace the suck, and get 1% better every day.


How would you improve the process above?

Struggling to hire a team of high performers?


Too often, we fixate on their skills and assume we can mold their character later. Big mistake.


You can't coach someone to care. 
You can't teach hustle, grit, or a can-do spirit. 


Those traits run deep, down to the core.


So what should you look for? 


Here's my hiring checklist to bring on high performers:


↳ Relentless Learners: People who continuously sharpen their skills and are hungry for growth.


▸ What new skills have you taught yourself recently?
▸ How do you stay ahead of the curve in your field?
▸ Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it.


↳ Ruthlessly Focused: Once you give them a goal they lock on to it and can easily eliminate the fluff.


▸ How do you prioritize your tasks and manage distractions?
▸ Give an example of a project where you had to cut the fluff and zero in on what mattered.
▸ How do you ensure you're always working on the most impactful things?


↳ Energizing Presence: They radiate enthusiasm and level up the whole team better.


▸ How would your colleagues describe your impact on team morale and energy?
▸ Tell me about a time you helped your team stay positive and motivated during a challenge.
▸ How do you maintain your own enthusiasm and resilience in tough times?


↳ Execution Machines: Implement fast, iterate faster. Less talking and more actions with results.


▸ What's your process for moving fast without sacrificing quality?
▸ Describe a project where you had to execute quickly and iterate on the fly.
▸ How do you balance speed with attention to detail?


↳ Team-First Attitude: Ego-free, always asking "How can I contribute more?"


▸ Tell me about a time you put the team's needs above your own.
▸ How do you handle conflicts or disagreements with colleagues?
▸ Describe a situation where you went above and beyond to help a teammate.


Use these questions to dig deep and uncover who they really are. 


Listen for specific examples, not just generic fluff.


Remember, you're not just filling a role. 
You're assembling a high performance team. 


Nail these 5 attributes and the rest will fall into place. 


You can train them on the tactics, but these qualities are non-negotiable.


Mindset over skillset. Character over credentials. Every single time!


Be relentless in your pursuit of the right people, and your business will thank you.

Everyone wants to go viral these days, 


And we all pay a heavy price for it.


I see this everywhere:


→ Templates kill clear messaging. 
→ Striving for popularity, not impact.
→ Creators Sacrificing their voice for likes. 


People worship the algorithm like a false idol, 


Killing their authenticity.


Killing LinkedIn. 


Making us cringe. 


This heresy has to stop! 


Before making your next post, ask yourself:


→ Am I sharing what matters to my readers,
→ Is this content aligned with my brand?
→ Can I refine, rework, or remove this?


When you put your readers first, you're:


• Authentic
• Impactful
• Tangible 


That's the power of authenticity.

I spent $100,000 building an email list. 


It didn't convert. 😭


Here are 5 painful lessons I learned:
→ We waited too long to engage with our list
→ Didn't validate key assumptions upfront
→ Our strategy wasn't tailored to the local market
→ Underestimated education and nurturing needed
→ Weren't agile enough to quickly pivot


Back in 2021, I partnered with my friend Chi Anh Dao. 


We launched Her Vietnam together, aiming to build Vietnam's largest Gen Z women's media site. 🚀


We put together a rockstar team:
- Assembled an editorial squad
- Hired top-notch designers
- Brought on a head of marketing


Our core metrics were simple:
- Email subscribers 📧
- Website traffic 🌐


The plan was straightforward:
- Grow a massive email list
- Launch an ecommerce store to monetize it 💰


We gave ourselves a year to make it happen. 


After 12 months, we had nearly 35,000 email subscribers. Anticipation was through the roof for the store launch! 🎉


However, weeks post-launch, click-through rates were abysmal. 📉 


Subscribers needed way more nurturing and education than we expected.


Instead of direct orders, our social media DMs were flooded with requests for product tutorials and info. 🙋‍♀️


We knew we had to pivot fast:
- Poured fuel on our social channels, especially Instagram 🔥
- Cranked out video content instead of written posts 📹
- Rebranded the store as HerGlow to better connect with our audience ✨


Fast forward to 2024, the retooled business is growing steadily month-over-month. We're all-in on TikTok this quarter and hunting for experts who've cracked the code on ecommerce in Vietnam. 👀


For all the entrepreneurs out there, here are the key takeaways from our rollercoaster ride:
→ Validate your assumptions early to avoid overinvesting 🧪
→ Build your product around real customer behavior 🔍
→ Stay ready to pivot on a dime based on market feedback 🌪️
→ Recognize that ecommerce and digital payments are still evolving in SEA 🌱


If you're an ecommerce founder building in Vietnam, slide into my DMs please! We're always down to swap insights with like-minded entrepreneurs. 🤝

Here’s a list of people I’d steer clear of like plague, I learned it the hard way, maybe you don’t have to: 


1. Folks who are overly ambitious but lazy. They are dangerous to be around. 


2. One who rather than offering constructive criticism to help you improve, they’d sugarcoat the truth.


3. Anyone who can’t genuinely celebrate your successes and instead harbors jealousy. Their evil eye brings about bad luck.


4. Portray the USA in either an overwhelmingly negative or positive manner.


Lastly, 


5. Who showcase ivy league school as their alma mater in their LinkedIn bio, after getting a distant certification from there. 
<<COMMENT>>
Spitting truth in these points. I've dealt with people like these before too.


- 1 will constantly have new ideas that they want you to help them with, but will lose interest quickly and end up wasting your time.
- 2, especially if they're an authority figure, prevent you from reaching your true potential.
- Most people who fit into 3 are simply insufferable to be around.
- 4 see the world as black or white which is misguided.
- 5 tells you a lot about who they are; they're future con artists.

🌶 For everyone claiming that AI might replace software engineers, here's my two cents:


😅 Just wanted to come up here and rant today


 "Brittle" probably best describes the current state of generative AI, and most practitioners would agree.


It's kind of funny how LLMs can be incredibly smart at times and completely fall apart at others. This brittleness makes it really hard to deploy them in production use-cases, let alone think about entirely replacing humans.


💡 In customer-facing applications, even a single break in the pipeline can mess up the entire experience. It gets even worse when you have a series of LLMs or multi-agents all relying on each other's outputs. 


❗Can we honestly discuss some of the really trivial brittle aspects that need fixing before we can claim hashtag#genAI will take over the world and replace humans?


⛳ Brittle Prompts: The way you phrase prompts can drastically change the output. Minor tweaks can lead to very different results, making prompt engineering a fragile task. Plus, there's zero backward compatibility with prompts – you have to change them every time your model updates or changes.


⛳ Brittle Outputs: Especially with structured outputs, there's always some exception handling needed. Inconsistent or erroneous outputs require a lot of manual intervention to ensure reliability.


⛳ Brittle Generation from Tail Knowledge: LLMs often struggle with generating accurate information from less common or niche topics, leading to incomplete or incorrect outputs and no! RAG is not a bulletproof solution to this!


⛳ Brittle Large Context Handling: Even though many LLMs claim to support extensive context lengths, they still face the "lost in the middle" problem when nearing their maximum context capacities. 


These are just a few of the aspects that need to be addressed before we can truly claim that generative AI is ready for prime time and complete autonomy. 




😃 I read a nice quote a while ago that said "AI won't replace you, but someone using AI will", and I still think that's accurate today. 


I'm likely the biggest advocate for this: we're seeing great progress and achieving things that were previously unattainable. However, the current state is a bit overhyped.


😁 I read this really cool post by Debarghya (Deedy) Das on SWEs being replaced by AI and decided to write this "practitioner" follow-up. Check it out: https://lnkd.in/eSBd7u7c


🚨To stay informed about hashtag#genai follow along, I share content daily! 
<<COMMENT>>
I mostly see that take from Instagram influencers who boast that pursuing a CS degree is worthless because of AI. For them, making extreme claims and perpetuating misinformation is how they retain their following. It's the Dunning-Kruger effect in action. I doubt many of them could name an AI model other than a mainstream LLM.

To add to Point 2, just because people don't leave a like on your post, it doesn’t mean they don’t like it. I think we, as content creators (yes, I guess I’m a content creator now), often get too caught up in vanity metrics. However, posts are just one small component of building our online presence. Personally, I’ve gotten far more opportunities by simply commenting on people’s posts and starting conversations.

My 2 cents on ramping up your job search -


What Does Not Work:


1. Inflating egos of entry/mid level engineers asking them for referrals specifically when their turnaround time is longer, some might even act God to give a referral that might not hold much depth. Referrals hold much more value coming from Senior/ Staff level employees, so choose your referee wisely. Don’t let a referral slow you down.




What works:


1. Setting Alerts on company’s job pages and try to be in initial pool of applicants. Value quality applications over blind shooting. 


2. Projects over courses for learning. Using services like Pramp for mock interviews.
<<COMMENT>>
Seeking referrals is like the blackjack tables of the job search: it could make you money, be worth an hour of your time, but it's not something to rely on.

To anyone on the verge of losing hope in this job market - Before securing my position at Apple I went through a rigorous journey:


- Over 350 job applications
- More than 50 interviews
- At least 12 final round interviews


and then there were 2 offers.


Here are the key insights from my experience:


- Self-belief is crucial.


- Every challenge is a growth opportunity. My numerous rejections have kept me perpetually prepared for interviews. I felt I articulated my projects better after every interview.


- Focus on the successes, not the failures. I don’t broadcast the 250+ rejections on LinkedIn instead, I celebrate the one job that mattered.


- Do not get attached to any one interview just because you believe you did well. There are multiple things that come in together for you to get that offer.

I posted my frustration with the Langchain source code. Who would have thought—it got me nearly 1000 followers along with a bunch of haters?


Why do I read source code in the first place? I initially built our LLM use cases with most of the code of our own and some parts from LlamaIndex. There was no doubt that no library could deliver 100% of the flexibility and customization I needed in our case, which is a conversational search engine and web info extractor.


True, if I use numpy or pandas, I most likely don’t need to look at the source code at all. Because they do exactly what they say they will do, compute things the way you want, and give you exactly the result you expect. But LLM applications are so close to our product, to our users, and they are like water, all up to you how to shape it. You want 100% clarity on what's going on. 


That’s why a lot of people find it easy to build a demo with these libraries but hard to adapt them in any way.
<<COMMENT>>
Whether it accidentally started a flame war or not, gaining 1000 followers from it in one day is wild. The most I've ever gotten in one day from a post is 800. 😆
